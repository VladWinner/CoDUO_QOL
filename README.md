- `cg_fixedAspectFOV` - Implements HOR+ FOV scaling when set to 1

## Installation
1. Download latest [release](https://github.com/Clippy95/CoDUO-YAP/releases/latest) or for semi-experimental builds use [actions](https://github.com/Clippy95/CoDUO-YAP/actions)
2. Extract contents to your game folder
3. Launch the game

### Installation notes
CoDUO-YAP can also be loaded using [Ultimate-ASI-Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader), by renaming the .dll extension to an .asi (name can also be changed), but this requires setting DontLoadFromDllMain=0 in UAL's global.ini for Steam versions.

## FAQ:
- Does this work with the original **Call Of Duty (2003)** release?
  
  No.
- Is it planned?

  No, if you want to play through the original COD1 campaign use ["Singleplayer Improved"](https://www.moddb.com/mods/singleplayer-improved) or ["United Fronts" ](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-duty-united-fronts)

- I'm running into issue **XYZ**
 
    Please report it on the [issues](https://github.com/Clippy95/CoDUO-YAP/issues) but try the latest [action](https://github.com/Clippy95/CoDUO-YAP/actions?query=branch%3Amaster) and see if the problem is already solved.
